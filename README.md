#Rails TextMate Bundle

##Description

This fork is meant to keep track of everyone's contribution in once centric
repository. Please feel free to fork and send pull requests and I'll try to keep
it up-to-date with all additions.
 
##Installation

1. $ `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/`
2. $ `git clone git://github.com/TechnoGate/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle.git Rails.tmbundle`
3. $ `osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'`

If you'd like to install all my bundles, check out this [script](http://gist.github.com/443129) written by [mkdynamic](http://github.com/mkdynamic).  It installs all bundles and backups any existing bundles with conflicting names.  Thanks Mark!
